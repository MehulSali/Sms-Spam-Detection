## **SMS/Email Spam Classifier (NLP Project)**  

### **Overview**  
Spam messages pose a significant challenge for communication platforms, leading to wasted time and potential security risks. This project tackles this issue by leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to classify SMS and email messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**. The system preprocesses text data, extracts meaningful features, and uses a trained machine learning model to provide real-time classifications through an intuitive web interface.

This project highlights my expertise in **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **building end-to-end NLP applications** with a focus on solving real-world problems.

### **Project Description**  
This application employs NLP techniques to clean and analyze text data and uses a **Logistic Regression model** for classification. It processes raw user input (SMS or email) to make predictions with high accuracy, offering an efficient tool for spam detection. The simple yet powerful web interface makes it accessible to a wide range of users.

### **Data Analysis and NLP Workflow**  
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**  
   - Labeled dataset with categories: **Spam** and **Not Spam**.  
   - Exploratory analysis to understand the distribution and frequency of spam messages.

2. **Preprocessing Pipeline**  
   - Text is converted to lowercase.  
   - Tokenized into words using **NLTK**.  
   - Stopwords and punctuation are removed.  
   - Words are reduced to their base form using **Porter Stemmer**.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - **TF-IDF Vectorization** converts text into meaningful numerical features.  

4. **Model Development**  
   - **Logistic Regression** was trained on the processed data, achieving an **accuracy of 95%**.  
   - Evaluated using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: Programming and preprocessing.  
- **Streamlit**: Web interface for user interaction.  
- **NLTK**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.  
- **Scikit-learn**: Vectorization and model training.  
- **Pickle**: Model serialization for deployment.
